TODO: should core ConfigMap changes initiate restart of components (mcs , target, client ) ? - not currently

TODO: Add relevant status fields
	- We need to decide what info we want to expose in the NVMesh CustomResource Status field

NOTE: label behavior for client and target:
  - nvmesh.excelero.com/nvmesh-client: ""
  - nvmesh.excelero.com/nvmesh-target-type: ""

  Client Daemonsets should apply to client
  Target Daemonset should apply to target
  MCS should apply to client

  User should label a node with client or both client and target or no nvmesh label
  labelling node with only target is not allowed

TODO: Test restarting each component in the solution   

TODO: TOMA crashes when trace daemon logs too long, requires manual clean up of /var/log/NVMesh

TODO: Create Script to collect TOMA trace logs

TODO: overlayfs: upper fs needs to support d_type. This is an invalid configuration - shows in dmesg
	- this is an issue with the underlying xfs which does not have a certain flag on, solution is to reformat the disk where kubelet is running on

TODO: Refactor General loop to reconcile objects, so that we have a SimpleObjectHandler that will just create and delete, and this can be inherited by for example MgmtStatefulSetHandler that will have an initObject() and shouldUpdate() and so on.

TODO: Refactor - make dynamic client code used in the MongoDB reconcile function to be more generic

TODO: Management update config using SIGUSR instead of restarting the Pod - mount config as volume, have the init.sh listen to file changes and trigger a signal upon change

TODO: Check Management handler (??)

TODO: Cluster Shutdown will not work - should we do anything about it ?

TODO: How to perform service restarts?

TODO: Add SCC to Scheme
